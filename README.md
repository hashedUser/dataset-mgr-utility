# dsfetch

dsfetch is a lightweight, CLI-first tool designed for machine learning practitioners who want a frictionless way to search, preview, and download datasets from multiple platforms—like Kaggle, Hugging Face, and UCI—without leaving the terminal. With a clean, unified interface and support for platform-specific identifiers, dsfetch streamlines dataset discovery and retrieval, making experimentation faster, reproducible, and less dependent on the browser. Whether you’re prototyping a new model or curating datasets for training, dsfetch gets you the data you need—fast.

## ⚙️ Core Features (MVP)

- 🔹 CLI interface to input Kaggle dataset handles  
- 🔹 Automated dataset download using `kagglehub`  
- 🔹 Directory-based organization under a central `/datasets` folder  
- 🔹 Smart detection of file vs. directory downloads  
- 🔹 Optional renaming and clean-up logic  
- 🔹 Local environment ready — no cloud dependency


## 🧗‍♂️ Vision

The long-term vision is to evolve this into a general-purpose dataset orchestration framework — integrating intelligent agents, metadata tracking, and reproducible workflows — so developers can spend less time managing datasets and more time building great models.
