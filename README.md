# dataset-mgr-utility
A lightweight Python CLI utility to automate dataset downloads, organization, and management for ML/DL workflows — starting with Kaggle, built for speed and structure.

In typical ML/DL workflows, managing datasets manually—downloading, renaming, organizing into folders—can become tedious and error-prone. This tool automates that process, letting developers focus on experimentation and modeling.

## ⚙️ Core Features (MVP)

- 🔹 CLI interface to input Kaggle dataset handles  
- 🔹 Automated dataset download using `kagglehub`  
- 🔹 Directory-based organization under a central `/datasets` folder  
- 🔹 Smart detection of file vs. directory downloads  
- 🔹 Optional renaming and clean-up logic  
- 🔹 Local environment ready — no cloud dependency


## 🧗‍♂️ Vision

The long-term vision is to evolve this into a general-purpose dataset orchestration framework — integrating intelligent agents, metadata tracking, and reproducible workflows — so developers can spend less time managing datasets and more time building great models.
